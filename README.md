# Takeaways from Reading How to Write Go Code
## Learned about the following things:
- The structure and organization of how there are repositories that can have modules which have packages which are made up of go source code files.
- How to import internal and external packages
- Installing packages as binaries/executables
- Using `go mod tidy` to add and remove dependencies
- How to use the lightweight testing libary that go has baked in. There are just file and function naming requirements to be able to run `go test`
